The devised model and equation found a larger percentage of eliminated student loan
debt is associated with lower probabilities of recessions. The model specifically found that
between Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren’s student loan debt forgiveness policies, Warren’s
policy reduced the probability of a recession by the greatest amount — the probability of
recession being 1.73545E-29 percent. This can be attributed to the fact that Elizabeth Warren’s
plan was to eliminate approximately 49.7% of student loan debt, or $640,000,000,000, and as the
percentage of GDP made up by student loans decreased, the probability of recession decreased as
well (Myong, 2019). The accuracy of this model is supported by the p < .05 , derived from the
chi-square value.
